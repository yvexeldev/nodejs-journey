   - Bookmarks: Save and organize frequently visited websites.
   - Extensions/Add-ons: Enhance browser functionality with custom tools.

#### 3. **Developer Tools**:
   - Built-in tools to debug and analyze web pages.
   - Found in most browsers (e.g., Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Tools).

#### 4. **Security and Privacy**:
   - **Private/Incognito Mode**: Browse without saving history or cookies.
   - **HTTPS Support**: Ensures secure communication between the browser and websites.
   - **Pop-up Blockers** and **Ad Blockers**: Prevent unwanted content.

### **How Browsers Work**
1. **User Input**:

3. **HTTP/HTTPS Request**:
   - The browser sends a request to the server hosting the website.
4. **Rendering Process**:
   - The server responds with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - The browser parses this data and renders it visually.
